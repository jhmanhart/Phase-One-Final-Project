# Phase 1 Final Project
## Personal Recipe Book

### Overview
This project is my Phase 1 Project for Flatiron School. My goal was to create a personal recipe book that could be used to easily store recipes in one spot. I came up with this idea in particular because I love cooking and love finding to recipes to make. However, I have gotten sick of having several links and tabs open on my computer and phone for recipes that I want to try. This app is a simple solution to that because it allows the user to store everything in once place and is very easy to use. 

### Features
This app will allow the user to have a personal recipe book that they can add recipes to. The user can submit a form and each recipe will be displayed in the table that includes the name, description and URL. 

### Requirements
    * Have json-server installed
    * Watch db.json while running the website


### Installation Instructions
    * Fork and clone
    * Open index.html in the browser
