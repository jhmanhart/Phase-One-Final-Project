# Idea
User is able to create their own recipe book out of recipes that they enjoy so they have all of them in once place and can easily access them.

### MVP
    * Have a form to create the recipe on (submit)
    * List out all of the recipes that have been submitted (DOMContentLoaded)
    * Remove recipes that have been added (click) 

### Stretch Goals
    * User can edit their recipes (submit)
    * User can search their recipes (submit)
    * User can like recipes (click)
    * User can comment on their recipes (submit)
